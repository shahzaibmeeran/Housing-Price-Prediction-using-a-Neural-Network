# Housing Price Prediction using Neural Network 🏠🤖

This project is a part of my assignment titled **"[Shahzaib_Meeran]_Assignment_04_HOUSE_PRICE_PREDICTION"**. The goal is to build a regression-based Neural Network model to predict housing prices using historical real estate data.

## 📌 Objective
Develop a deep learning model using TensorFlow/Keras to accurately estimate house prices based on various features like number of rooms, area, location, and other attributes.

## 📂 Dataset
- Source: [Housing Prices Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/housing-prices-dataset)
- Format: CSV file containing features and target price

## 🔧 Steps Covered
1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Scaling
4. Neural Network Architecture Design (using Keras)
5. Model Training and Validation
6. Evaluation using MAE, MSE, RMSE
7. Loss Curve Visualization

## 📈 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow / Keras

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

## 💡 Result
The model demonstrates how a basic neural network can be applied effectively to real-world regression problems like housing price prediction.
